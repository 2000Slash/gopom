# gopom - a maven pom.xml parser

gopom is a Golang module to easily parse and work with maven pom.xml files.

Supports the offical pom.xml structure that can be read about [here](https://maven.apache.org/ref/3.6.3/maven-model/maven.html).

# Modifications and why

This is forked from: github.com/2000Slash/gopom, but with the mod to round trip the Configuration correctly (for example Plugin.Configuration). Correctly for my use case is not worrying about turning it into modifiable struct, but that it roundtrips correctly (parse, modify some bits, then marshal), should produce a diff that makes sense. With the upstream, it drops a bunch of stuff unless it's a strict key/value list.


## Installation

```bash
go get -u github.com/2000Slash/gopom
```


## Usage
To load and parse a pom.xml file it is possible to use the `gopom.Parse(path string)` function which will load the file at the given path and return the parsed pom.  
See below for example:
```go
package main

import (
	"github.com/2000Slash/gopom"
	"log"
)

func main() {

	var pomPath string = ... // Path to the pom.xml file
	parsedPom, err := gopom.Parse(pomPath)
	if err != nil {
		log.Fatal(err)
	}
}
```

If one already has the pom.xml loaded as a string or bytes you can use `encoding/xml` from the standard library.  
This can be seen below:
```go
package main

import (
	"encoding/xml"
	"github.com/2000Slash/gopom"
	"log"
)

func main() {
	var pomString string = ... // The pom string

	var parsedPom gopom.Project
	err := xml.Unmarshal([]byte(pomString), &parsedPom)
	if err != nil {
		log.Fatal(err)
	}
}
```

You can also marshal the project back to an xml:
```go
package main

import (
	"fmt"
	"log"

	"github.com/2000Slash/gopom"
)

func main() {

	var pomPath string = "./pom.xml"
	parsedPom, err := gopom.Parse(pomPath)
	if err != nil {
		log.Fatal(err)
	}
	output, _ := parsedPom.Marshal()
	fmt.Println(string(output))
}
```
